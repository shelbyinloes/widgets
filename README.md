###Description: 
    This is a 'sandbox' app where I can house many smaller applications in one. Anywhere from
    a small clock, to telling the weather, to games! The application is built using create-react-app and has several other dependencies. It primarily houses front-end development projects. 

###Why: 
    I created this 'Widget Workshop' so I could work on small projects and have a place to house them together. This cuts down on a lot of time creating a new repo or creating an app from scratch each time. 

###Goals: 
    To continue building fun, small apps that I can showcase to friends, family, and my professional network. As for now, my short term goals are to add in a better designed navigation bar and have the apps show up on the main part of the page so a user doesn't have to scroll down each time they want to view the component. 

###Deployment: 
    Site is deployed on Netlify: (https://widgetworkshop.netlify.com/)

###Issues/Bugs:
    This is still a styling work in progress. 
    I may only be using front-end technologies to this application, it will be hard work to implement a backend from how this is set up currently.
